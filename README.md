# Jitter external to find contours in binary images
### Creates custom 2D shapes starting from a binary raster image

The first outlet outputs the contours as ordered sequence of points organized in a one dimensional 3 planes jitter matrix.
* plane 1: contains x coordinates (based on pixels)
* plane 2: contains y coordinates (based on pixels)
* plane 3: contains the contour index (often the object finds multiple contours in the binary image)

It is also possible to simplify the contours playing with the "epsilon" attribute.
